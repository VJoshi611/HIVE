1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
-->
hadoop fs -put sales_order_data.csv /tmp

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
--> 
create table sales_order_csv
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1"); 

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
--> 
load data inpath '/tmp/sales_order_csv.csv' into table sales_order_csv;

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
--> 
create table sales_order_data_orc
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc;


6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
-->  
from sales_order_csv insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select *;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
-->  select year_id, sum(sales) as sales from sales_order_orc group by year_id order by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
--> select productline, sum(quantityordered) as max_order from sales_order_orc group by productline order by max_order desc limit 1; 

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
--> select qtr_id, sum(sales) as sales from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
--> select qtr_id, sum(sales) as sale from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id order by sale limit 1  ;
 
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
--> 
select country as max_sale_country, sum(sales) as sale from sales_order_orc group by country order by sale desc limit 1 
union
select country as min_sale_country, sum(sales) as min_sale from sales_order_orc group by country order by min_sale limit 1  ;
 
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
--> select postalcode, qtr_id, sum(sales) from sales_order_orc group by postalcode, qtr_id;

h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
--> select month_id, year_id, max(quantityordered) as max_order group by year_id, month_id order by max_order desc limit 1;
